## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- PostgreSQL (version 12 or higher)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd waterqualityanalysis
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Install PostgreSQL packages:
   ```
   pnpm add pg pg-hstore
   ```

### Database Setup
1. Create a PostgreSQL database for the application.
2. Configure the database connection in `server/db/index.ts` using the `pg` library.

### Running the Application
1. Start the development server:
   ```
   pnpm dev
   ```
   This will run both the client and server on a single port (8080) with hot reloading.

### API Routes
- The API routes are located in the `server/routes` directory. You can create new routes to interact with the PostgreSQL database.

### Migrations
- Use a migration tool like `sequelize-cli` or `knex` to manage your database schema. Create migration files in the `server/db/migrations` directory.

### Testing
- Ensure that your PostgreSQL server is running and that you can connect to it.
- Test your API routes to verify that they can read from and write to the database.
